<h1>Black Jack</h1>

<h2>Are you Vegas Ready?</h2>


<h3>Inspiration</h3>
I have always enjoyed Black Jack.  I'm not Casino ready, but I thought it would be fun to design a game to help me practice.

<h3>Struggles and Successes</h3> 
I am still struggling with writing my functions so they would often not work the way as I expected.  In particular, my loops continued to repeat more often than needed.  I learned a lot about conditional statements with this game.  



<h3>Future Features</h3>
The ability to add additional Players.

The ability to change style of play (for example: Vegas Style, Jackpot City Casino,House Rules )

Ability to change Deck Styles.

<h3>Version 2</h3>
On my first presentation of this project, I was only able to play the game in the console.  There was no dom manipulation.  I have updated the game to include a user interface.  There are still more items that can be improved upon before the showcase.  Some of those include, a reset button so that the player does not have to constantly refresh the browser.  I would also like to add more design and include the aces in the game.  I want to figure out the code that will allow me to use Ace as either 11 or 1. Working on this project a second time made me feel more confident in my skills as I only had to ask for help twice with 2 small errors.  I think my skills will continue to improve with practice and time.
