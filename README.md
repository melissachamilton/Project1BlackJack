### Requirements
For your first project you will build a simple game as a Web Application. You must choose from one of the games listed below!

### Objectives
The objectives of this project are to:

* Demonstrate your ability to use `HTML` and `CSS` to build and style an intuitive web application
* Demonstrate your competancy in _DOM manipulation_ using JavaScript
* Publish your source code to _GitHub_ with a solid `README.md` describing the project
    * [README Example 1](https://github.com/iamsydsmith/tic-tac-toe)
    * [README Example 2](https://github.com/wschaeferiii/footup)
* Deploy your application to a production environment such as [Netlify Drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop)
* Present your project in a presentation style format

## Planning and Deliverables

### Make a new repo!
Before you begin, make a new github repo for your project. **Do not** begin your project within the class repo.

### Technical Requirements
Your app must:

* Render a game in the browser
* Use Javascript or jQuery for DOM manipulation
* Switch turns between two players and/or use some A.I. to control the game.
* Design logic for winning & visually display which player won
* Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files
* Have high quality code:
    - Follow accepted naming conventions
    - Consistent indentation
    - Well-structured and readable code
    - Semantic naming of variables, functions, CSS classes, etc.
    - Short and clear functions that _do one thing_
    - Efficient code- if you have your MVP, refactor
    - DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) code
* Deploy your game online, where the rest of the world can access it. 
    - We suggest you deploy your project to [Netlify Drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop).

### How to Get Started
* First design your _MVP_ (Minimum Viable Product). Have a plan for completing an MVP before getting too involved with _advanced_ features.
* Use _Trello_ to prioritize your User Stories / features. Focus on what is most important / critical to success.
* _Timebox_ any experimental or optional ideas, features, or technologies. Remember that good _time management_ is key!
* Commit your code early and often with good commit messages.
* Use Git Branching for experimenting with different ideas and technologies.

### How To Submit
* Submit your project github link to the GA Grader by the time indicated on the class schedule.
